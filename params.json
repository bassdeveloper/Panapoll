{"name":"Panapoll","tagline":"Shoot for the stars","body":"![](http://wallpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/High-definition-tree-hd-wallpapers-700x438.jpg)\r\n# Welcome to Panapoll.com.\r\nThis is the easiest way for photography enthusiasts to interact on a niche forum. The website is the perfect place for photography contests. Have talent and need recognition? Participate in contests to build your reputation and stand a chance to win attractive prizes in the form of money or equipment! Hone your skills even further by participating in discussions with our tight-knit community of photography enthusiasts! Do you need photographs to help market a new or existing product? By becoming a paid user, you can host themed contests to find the photographs and talent according to your needs! After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n## Get Started\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use as your dashboard.  You can go ahead and click 'Submit Entry' to submit your photographs for the competitions . You can easily go back to edit your photos before publishing. After publishing your photo, you can revisit the competition and switch to another theme-competition. Your Photographs and content will be preserved and make a portfolio.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic meme - generator, push a photograph to your profile to create a meme manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, Panapoll supports Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated by Team Panapoll:\r\nRishabh Chakrabarti (@bassdeveloper)\r\nVaibhav Sharma (@v4iv)\r\nSaurabh Jha (@sjdexter)\r\nVineet Patavari (vineetp007)\r\nSarang Kurani (@SarkariLightbulb)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the Website?
